Maze Shooter Console Game
Welcome to the game! Written below are some basic instructions on the mechanics to play the game, and its set of rules.

"[user@sahara ~]$" will come up on your terminal after you run the terminal.

Enter “python Main.py” in order to run the game.

The player (‘P’) starts the game at a random location on the map, and they will be given 200 seconds to move around the map while finding and shooting targets based on the order of their colour. 

As soon as the game starts, the timer will start to tick down.

Targets on the map will be marked as “Q”, and each of them will have different colours.

The walls on the map will be marked by a “-”, while the empty spaces you can move on will be marked by a “.”.

The player will be given a certain number of bullets that they can use to shoot the targets. However, there will be bullets in several empty spaces on the floor that the player can pick up.

If the player manages to kill all the coloured targets in the correct order without spending all their bullets and under the time limit, then they win the game! 

However, if at any point in the game the player runs out of bullets, there are still targets remaining on the map, and no bullets can be picked up from the ground, the player loses the game. If the player shoots a target with the wrong colour, they will also automatically lose the game. And if the timer runs out while targets have not been shot, the player loses the game.

In order to move your character:
When the game asks for you to “Choose your Move”, press the “M” key.
Press the “W” key on the keyboard to move your character upwards on the map.
Press the “A” key on the keyboard to move your character to the left on the map.
Press the “S” key on the keyboard to move your character downwards on the map.
Press the “D” key on the keyboard to move your character to the right on the map.

In order to fire your bullet:
When the game asks for you to “Choose your Move”, press the “S” key.
Press the “W” key on the keyboard to shoot your bullet upwards.
Press the “A” key on the keyboard to shoot your bullet to the left.
Press the “S” key on the keyboard to shoot your bullet downwards.
Press the “D” key on the keyboard to shoot your bullet to the right.





IMPORTANT TIPS:

When the player is moving their character, they should try to avoid moving them into walls, as this is an invalid move.
The player should also avoid moving into a target.
Note which coloured targets you will have to shoot first!
The player can break through walls with their bullet! However, keep in mind that you need 2 bullets to break 1 wall.
Bullets have an unlimited range!
Collect bullets in empty spaces in order to break more walls!
Each shot will cost 1 bullet unless shooting the wall.
Killing a target will grant you 1 bullet.
